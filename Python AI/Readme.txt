Python is commonly used to develop AI applications, such as improving human to computer interactions, identifying trends, and making predictions. 
One way that Python is used for human to computer interactions is through chatbots. Chatbots use artificial intelligence and natural language processing to allow us 
to communicate with a computer more naturally. We interact with chatbots using text or voice commands when we are trying to contact customer service or when we are 
asking our Alexa or Google Home to answer a question or perform a task. Let's learn how to make AI in Python!
